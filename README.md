## Introduction
This repository provides an end-to-end solution for sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews. It covers the entire pipeline from data preprocessing to sentiment classification using machine learning models.



## Text Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps involve:

Converting text to lowercase,

Removing punctuations and numbers,

Removing stopwords,

Removing rare words,

Tokenization,

Lemmatization


## Text Visualization
We use bar plots and word clouds to visualize the most frequent words in the reviews.

## Sentiment Analysis
Using the VADER sentiment analyzer to calculate sentiment scores for each review.


## Feature Engineering
Creating count vectors and TF-IDF vectors from the reviews.


## Sentiment Modeling
Training logistic regression and random forest models to classify sentiments.

## Results
The results of the sentiment classification models are evaluated using cross-validation scores.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates an effective pipeline for sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews, from text preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
